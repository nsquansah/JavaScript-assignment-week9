SUMMARY OF LESSON MATERIALS
===========================

## Lesson 1: JavaScript array methods
reference: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp

These methods provide essential functionality for manipulating arrays in JavaScript. They can be used to add, remove, and modify elements, as well as iterate through array elements for various tasks.

push(): Adds elements to the end of an array.
pop(): Removes the last element from an array.
shift(): Removes the first element from an array.
unshift(): Adds elements to the beginning of an array.
indexOf(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element in an array.
splice(): Modifies an array by adding, removing, or replacing elements.
slice(): Creates a new array containing a portion of the original array.
forEach(): Executes a function for each element in an array.

## Lesson 2: JavaScript functions
reference: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp

Functions are blocks of code that can be called to perform a specific task. They can be used to reduce repetition in code, and to modularize complex programs into simpler, easier-to-understand components.

Functions are declared with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names should be descriptive of the task they perform. The code to be executed, also known as the function body, is enclosed in curly braces {}.

Functions can be called by using the function name, followed by parentheses ().
Functions can be called multiple times to reuse code.
Functions can be passed data, known as parameters, through the use of function arguments.
Functions can return data as a result of executing the function body using the return keyword.
Functions can be assigned to variables, and stored in data structures such as arrays and objects.

## Lesson 3: control flow statements
reference: https://www.javascripthelp.org/learn/basics/control-flow-statements/

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution based on different conditions. JavaScript supports the following control flow statements − if...else statement − executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. if...else if....else statement − \
for statement − loops through a block of code a number of times. for...in statement − loops through the properties of an object. 
while statement − loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true. 
do...while statement − loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true. 
break statement − terminates a switch or a loop. continue statement − jumps out of a loop and starts at the top.
